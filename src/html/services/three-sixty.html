                    We onboard clients between the 1st and the 15th of every month and we currently have the capacity to accept five qualified clients per month for this service.<br/><br/>Weâ€™re so confident that you will enjoy your 360Â° Promotion Partnership services that we will never ask you to sign a contract. Other marketing agencies would typically ask you to sign a 6 or even 12 month commitment but under the 360Â° Promotion Partnership plan you are not bound to a time requirement because we believe strongly that you will not want to discontinue our partnership.<br/><br/>All of these marketing services could individually could cost as much as $10,000 upfront but with our 360Â° Promotion Partnership service you pay a one-time $3,000 onboarding fee and after that we receive $1,500 per month or 15% of your companyâ€™s gross profit for the previous month, whichever is higher. This pricing structure allows your company easier access to transformative marketing and higher revenue by slashing the amount you would typically have to pay to get started with our services.<br/><br/>ðŸŽ‰ Bonus: Need help with closing customers after receiving new leads?
