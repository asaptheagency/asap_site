Please add another page to this website, please do not add any links to this as I do not want users to go there, it is just for me. Please ensure that the style is similar to the rest of the website, except I don’t want any patterns in the background. Here is what I want it to consist of:

This will have two features, both of them will have a similar purpose , which is this: a customer will click on a button and through the use of open AI ChatGPT, API, a positive review intended for the business that they just visited will be generated, pasted to their clipboard, and then the user will be automatically directed to Google maps. Here is where the two features differ: one is just going to be a standalone button that does all of this. When the user clicks on the button the positive review is generated and the user is taken directly to Google maps. The second version is a form. The form asks the user questions like who the customer interacted with, was there service, timely, is there any thing in particular that stood out about the service that they received, would they recommend the service to a friend, would they visit again, and optionally any additional comments that they would like to add. After that, the user clicks the submit button and the ChatGPT API incorporates the users responses to create a custom positive review, it copies that custom review to the users, clipboard, and then take them directly to Google maps.

Essentially, the differences between the two are that one of them is a general AI generated review and the other is an AI generated review that is customized specifically to what the user entered into the form .

I want to utilize an iframe so that I could then take one of the features of this application of my choice and embed it directly into a client’s website so that their customers can utilize one of these features. I do not want to put both of the features onto my clients website, I want to be able to choose one and I want to utilize the iframe to then customize the application according to the design of my clients website, and if I could also find some way to put specific details about the nature of their business into the ChatGPT integration, that would be great so that the review can talk specifically about what exact service their customer received.


* I want to be able to add the ChatGPT API into the iframe if possible so that I can put a different one in for each client. If you know of a better way for me to do this, I am open to that as well. 
* Let’s just include the words “Generate review“ inside of the buttons.
* Remember, depending on what my client wants I’m only gonna put one of these onto their website so let’s remove the h1 altogether, turn both of the h2s into h1s, and put a description under each one of the new titles that describes what the feature does. Please be a little more succinct in your description.
* please make it so that before a customer is allowed to click the button they are required to enter a value for any field that is not optional. If they try to click the submit button and they do not have every required field filled out a read text should appear that notifies them that they are missing required fields.
* I know there has to be a way that I can customize each implementation with the iframe. I can’t make a new version of this for every client, I literally just want to open up their HTML or react, application and paste a few lines of code in there. Please do your best to make it that simple for me. I want to customize things like: like background, color, text color, button, color, etc. and of course, if there’s anything else that you can think of like height and width or anything else, I would appreciate it
* Underneath each feature, please put “Developed and designed by www.asaptheagency.com” just like we have it on the rest of the website . I wanted to look exactly the same. The reason why I think it should be on this page twice is because once again this particular page is not intended for users. I think I should have it underneath both features because I’m only giving one feature to a customer.
* Please make it so t hat it’s going to be pretty easy for me to copy this code and paste it into a client’s website? I am a developer so you don’t have to worry about me not knowing code. If it’s not easy, please make any changes that you need to make. If it is easy, please give me instructions on how to copy what I need to copy it in order toput this into a client’s website.
* Please incorporate space into the iframe for me to enter a specific details about the client? Some of my clients are PDR shops, some of them are attorneys, so regardless of which feature I am going to give them I want to be able to give the ChatGPT API a little bit of information about the clients business itself. If you could do it in a way that the customer who is leaving the review does not have to worry about it that would be great. I would prefer to enter these details as I customize the iframe. 
* I created two prompts; one for each feature and I included in each one the parameters that I would like to use. The first prompt should be connected to the first feature and the second prompt should be connected to the second feature. Please read the prompts and tell me if you’d like them, also tell me if you understand exactly why I made two separate ones. Here are the prompts
* Generate a 5-star review for `businessName` based on the following customer details: `businessDetails`. The review should highlight the positive aspects of the specific service described. The review should sound genuine, enthusiastic, and reflect a high level of satisfaction. It should be suitable for posting on review platforms like Google, and should make potential customers feel confident about choosing `businessName`. Ensure that the review is personalized, positive, and promotes the quality of service at `businessName` 
* Generate a 5-star review for `businessName` based on the following customer details: `businessDetails`.

It should be suitable for posting on review platforms like Google, and should make potential customers feel confident about choosing `businessName`. Ensure that the review is personalized, positive, and promotes the quality of service at `businessName`.
* let’s give each feature an H1  and under each one of them  put regular body text that briefly describes what it is that this application does.
* The question about the prompt service should be a radial button that gives them the options yes or no
* Let’s put the question “Anything in particular that stood out about the service?” Just above the final question and let’s make it read “Was there anything in particular that stood out about the service?” And let’s make it optional if it is not optional already.
* Let’s make all of the yes or no questions radial buttons
