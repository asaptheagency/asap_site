I know that this prompt is a lot to take in so before you begin please organize your thoughts and create a through/robust plan of action in order to ensure that you do not forget anything. I would love to see the plan of action that you come up with in a numbered list. Here's the prompt:


Replace the current "Services" section on the homepage with a new "Industries We Serve" section and have three cards in this section that look and function exactly like the cards that currently exist in the "services" section. Don't delete the services section or the cards in the services section or the links to it that exist now…comment it all out so that it's no longer visible from the site. Technically the services pages should be live but no one should be able to find them because the links to those pages will be gone. I want three cards in this new section: "Law Firms", "PDR Shops", and "Roofers"

- Each card should have:
  • Industry title
  • Subtitle or tagline (e.g., "Growth systems for firms under $1M/year")
  • Image (i have attached corresponding images)
- On click, each card should route to a dedicated page:
  • /industries/law-firms
  • /industries/pdr-shops
  • /industries/contractors

Do not include pricing anywhere on the homepage or subpages.
The layout should be scalable — easy to add future industries

Style should match the rest of the site (use global styling or Tailwind if applicable).

Whenever you see the phrase "* ASAP's proprietary "Review Generator"" below know that i want you to turn that text into a link that routes to the current "Review Generators" page. 

Whenever you see the phrase "[Contact Us Button]" below know that i want you to turn that into a button that routes to the link that i have for my Google Booking page. I know you have it

Replace the "Solutions" dropdown in the header with an "Industries" dropdown with the three industries referenced above

Replace the "Solutions" section in the footer with an "Industries" section with links to the three industries referenced above

Replace the favicon with the robot logo

Create the copy that goes in each card
