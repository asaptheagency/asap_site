- **Paragraph:**

**3. Offer Section**
- **Headline:** "Launch Special Pricing"

- **Paragraph 1:**
"Did you know that businesses who ask for reviews at the point of service see up to **3x more responses**? (Source: GatherUp) That’s why this tool exists. Customers are most likely to leave a review when the experience is still fresh — not hours later when they've forgotten. Our system helps you capture that moment and turn it into a public 5-star endorsement."

- **Paragraph 2:**
"You don’t need to chase people. You need a system that does the asking for you — instantly, and in a way that feels natural. That’s exactly what these two options deliver. One is a simple, powerful button. The other adds smart feedback customization. Both are designed to get results fast — with no subscriptions, no fluff, and no hassle."

- **Two Tiered Boxes (Side by Side):**

  **Standard – $500**
  - Review Generator button that creates AI-generated review text, copies the review to the user’s clipboard and takes them to your Google Maps profile
  - Branding for one location
  - Website integration

  **Premium – $1,000**
  - Review Generator form that customizes review text based on customer input
  - Clipboard copy + Google Maps redirect
  - Multi-location branding (up to 3)
