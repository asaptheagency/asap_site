Let’s design a frontend only one-page swiss modernism website. I will provide details of the company that this website is intended for at the end of this prompt. The design must be modern, design-forward, responsive and funnel‑oriented, guiding visitors to interact with the embedded chatbot for a free estimate or answers to their questions.  I will provide you with an aminos.ai script later which will embed the chatbot. No need to make a chatbot, it will appear in the bottom-left corner of the page after i give you the script.

Use micro‑interactions, smooth scrolling, plenty of parallax animations, and accessible design elements to create an engaging experience.  Please make the cursor unique in some way that correlates to the overall design. 

Please add some glowing and hovering effects on some of the appropriate divs, use https://nicolasfol.webflow.io/ and https://blazetype.eu/blog/swiss-modernism for reference in regards to the overall design. animate upon mouse hovers. i want this webite to feel like someone spent $90,000 on it. It needs to look outstanding as if a billion dollar agency designed it.

Please make the content of each section fade in upon scroll in an alternating manner; the hero and nav text fade in from the left to their current positions when the page loads, the text from the next section fades in from the right when it comes into view, etc.

Please utilize a funnel-style layout that engages users as they travel down the page, please write compelling copy

Colors: red, #191919 (off-black), #e6e6e6 (white)

The company:
AspireIt Software Automation & Promotion (ASAP for short)
Please make the name of the company take up the entire hero section. The name of the company should be in black font but make the first letters of each word red in an effort to show the user why we call it ASAP
Please add the tagline “We can when we AspireIt” somewhere in the hero

Services:
I would like to have one section that houses all of the services with clickable tabs, each time a tab is selected the copy for that service will appear. I will provide you with the copy for the services here, please use each one verbatim:
