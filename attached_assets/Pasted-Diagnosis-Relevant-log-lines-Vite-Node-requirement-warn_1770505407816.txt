Relevant log lines:

Vite Node requirement warning: line 114.
PostCSS warning (non-fatal): line 117.
Fatal error — missing import: line 120 and line 121.
Error type and cause:

The build fails because Vite cannot resolve an import: client/src/pages/home (imported by client/src/App.tsx) — ENOENT no such file or directory. This means the path used by the import does not match any committed file in the repo (commonly caused by a wrong filename, wrong directory, missing file, or case mismatch on a case-sensitive filesystem like Netlify's).
There is also a Node.js version mismatch: Netlify is using Node.js 18.20.8 but Vite v7 requires Node 20.19+ or 22.12+ (line 114). That is a separate issue you should fix to avoid runtime incompatibilities (see solution below). The PostCSS message on line 117 is a warning and not the build blocker.
Solution

Fix the missing import (primary cause)

Verify the file exists in the repo and is committed:
Check locally or in the GitHub repo that a file under client/src/pages exists. Example command locally:
bash
ls -la client/src/pages
git ls-files client/src/pages
If the file is missing, add/commit it (git add/commit/push) so Netlify can see it.
If the file is present but the import path in App.tsx uses the wrong case or name, correct the import to match the exact filename (Linux is case-sensitive). Open client/src/App.tsx (repo link) and locate the import. Example:
Link to file: https://github.com/asaptheagency/asap_site/blob/main/client/src/App.tsx
Common fix examples — change the import to the exact filename/casing:
If the real file is Home.tsx or Home/index.tsx:
TypeScript/JS import change:
tsx
// wrong (causes ENOENT on case-sensitive builds)
import Home from './pages/home';

// correct (match file name exactly)
import Home from './pages/Home';
// or, if it's index under Home folder:
import Home from './pages/Home/index';
Commit and push the corrected import or the missing file.
Fix the Node.js version used by Netlify (recommended)

Vite printed that Node.js 18.20.8 is being used but Vite requires 20.19+ or 22.12+ (line 114). Update Netlify’s build Node version so it uses a compatible Node release.
Ways to set Node on Netlify (choose one):
Add an .nvmrc at repo root containing a supported version, e.g.:
text
20.19.0
Or set the "engines" field in package.json:
json
"engines": {
  "node": ">=20.19.0"
}
Or set the NODE_VERSION environment variable in Netlify UI or netlify.toml.
Netlify docs for changing Node versions: https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/manage-dependencies/#node-js-and-javascript
After changing, trigger a new deploy.
Re-run build

After applying the fix (corrected import or committed file) and updating Node version, push changes to trigger a new build on Netlify. The missing-import error should be resolved; if Vite still complains about Node, follow step (2) to ensure the build runs on Node 20.19+ (or 22.12+).
Notes

The PostCSS plugin message on line 117 is a warning and not the cause of the failure, but if you encounter styling/asset transform issues later, revisit your PostCSS configuration.
